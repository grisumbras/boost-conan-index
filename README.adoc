= Boost Conan Index

Conan package recipe index for Boost libraries. The project can be cloned and
used as a
https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/conan_repositories/setup_local_recipes_index.html[
local recipe index].

== Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/grisumbras/boost-conan-index -b index -d 1
conan remote add boost-conan-index ./boost-conan-index
```

== Usage

When added the recipe index behaves like a regular conan remote. However note
that the index doesn't provide any prebuilt packages, thus anything installed
from it would require a `--build=missing` or a similar flag (see
https://docs.conan.io/2/reference/commands/install.html[`conan install`
documentation]).
